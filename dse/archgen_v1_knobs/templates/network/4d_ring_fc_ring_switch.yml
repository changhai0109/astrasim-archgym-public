# Analytical Network Input File

# 3D topology with 64 NPUs (2 x 8 x 4)
# 1st Dim is (bi-directional) Ring, 2nd Dim is FullyConnected, and the last dim is Switch.
# Each link BW is (200, 100, 50) GB/s (per each dimension and per each direction)
# and link BW is (50, 500, 2000) ns.


# 3D topology
topology: [ Ring, FullyConnected, Ring, Switch ]  # Ring, Switch, FullyConnected

# 2 x 8 x 4 = 64 NPUs
npus_count: [ 4, 8, 4, 8 ]  # number of NPUs

# Bandwidth per each dimension and direction (per link)
bandwidth: [ 187.5, 25.0, 25.0, 100.0 ]  # GB/s

# Latency per each dimension and direction
latency: [ 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0 ]  # ns
